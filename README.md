# Job Trace Analysis Tool

This application delivers extensive plots for analyzing job traces with dynamic functionalities, concentrating on geometric, user, and failure characteristics. In its current iteration, it exclusively showcases pre-existing job traces for analysis. A forthcoming update will introduce the capability for users to upload and analyze their own job traces, significantly enhancing its utility and flexibility.

## Live Application

The project is also live at [https://lumos-job-traces.streamlit.app/](https://lumos-job-traces.streamlit.app/). You can access the web application to analyze job traces interactively without installing the software locally.
